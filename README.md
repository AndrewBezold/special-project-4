## Environment
1. Hex-Based
  - Pros
    - Simplified
    - Easier to implement and consider
    - Can upgrade to freeform after environment is more solidified
  - Cons
    - Not freeform
    - Limited usefulness
2. Freeform
  - Pros
    - More useful on a real scale
  - Cons
    - More difficult to implement

## Agents
- Genetic
  - External form determined by genes
  - AI (neural net?) hidden architecture determined by genes
  - Inputs/Outputs determined by form
    - Inputs are sensory (sight, sound, etc)
    - Outputs are motor (movement, voice, etc)
